module: ibm_iam_service_id_info
short_description: Manage C(iam_service_id) for IAM Identity Services.
author: IBM SDK Generator (@ibm)
version_added: "1.0.0"
description:
  - This module retrieves one or more C(iam_service_id) for IAM Identity Services.
requirements:
  - "IamIdentityV1"
options:
  include_history:
    description: "Defines if the entity history is included in the response."
    type: bool
  id:
    description: "Unique ID of the service ID."
    type: str
  include_activity:
    description: "Defines if the entity's activity is included in the response. Retrieving activity
      data is an expensive operation, so only request this when needed."

  - name: IBM Cloud Schematics docs
    description: "Use Schematics to run your Ansible playbooks to provision, configure, and manage IBM Cloud resources."
    link: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics
notes:
  - "Authenticate this module by using an IBM Cloud API key. For more information about working with IBM Cloud API keys,
    see I(Managing API keys): U(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey)."
  - "To configure the authentication, set your IBM Cloud API key on the C(IC_API_KEY) environment variable.
    The API key will be used to authenticate all IBM Cloud modules that use this environment variable."
