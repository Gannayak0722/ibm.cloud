              description: "Action control for adding access policies to an enterprise-managed access group in a
                child account. If an access group administrator in a child account adds a policy, they
                can always update or remove it. Note that if conflicts arise between an update to this
                control in a new version and polices added to the access group by an administrator in
                a child account, you must resolve those conflicts in the child account. This prevents
                breaking access in the child account. For more information, see [Working with
